# miniprot-protein-annotator

- a protein coding regions annotator that will take the alignment file in the PAF/GFF format and will generate the fasta from the corresponding fasta files for the aligned regions.
- implemented faster rates so that you can parse as many aligned regions as you want.
- you can also create the protein tokenzier from the same for machine learning.

```
 # align your genome with the given protein  using the miniprot such as 
   miniprot --gff genome.fasta protein.fasta > sample.gf
```
 - and then run the proteinannotator to extract all the complete coding regions
